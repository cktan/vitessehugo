	<p class="lead text-center">World's First Open-Source and
	Massively Parallel Data Platform</p>

	<p>Greenplum provides powerful and rapid analytics on extreme 
	data volumes. For details on the project, see 
	<a target="_blank" href='https://greenplum.org/'>Greenplum Database.</a>
	Here are some highlights:
	<ul>
	<li>Massively parallel shared-nothing architecture</li>
	<li>Petabyte-scale loading</li>
	<li>Innovative query optimizer</li>
	<li>Polymorphic data storage and execution</li>
	<li>Advanced Machine Learning</li>
	<li>External data accessiblity</li>
	</ul>


	<h3 class='title'>Pre-built Binaries</h3>

	<p>The Greenplum Database&copy; project is released under the
	Apache 2 license. To enhance adoption of the technology,
	Vitesse Data provides pre-built binary packages for multiple
	platforms. These packages are available for
	<a href="download/">free download.</a></p>

	<h3 class='title'>Support Contracts</h3>

	<p>A distributed database is by definition more delicate than
	a standalone database.  Many data processing components are
	involved, and their reliability directly contribute to the
	stability of the platform. Enterprise customers are well
	advised to consider third party support for their mission
	critical open-source Greenplum clusters.</p>

	<p>With many years of code-level development experience on the
	Greenplum database, and with the founders of the Company being
	on the original engineering team of Greenplum (pre EMC
	acquisition), we are uniquely qualified to provide support on
	open-source Greenplum database.</p>
