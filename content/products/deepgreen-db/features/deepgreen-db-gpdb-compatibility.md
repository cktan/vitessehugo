### 100% Compatible with Greenplum DB

Deepgreen DB is derived from the open source Greenplum DB project. It
maintains 100% compatibility with Greenplum DB. From SQL and stored
procedures syntax, to storage formats on disk, to operation utilities
such as <code>gpstart</code> or <code>gpfdist</code>, Deepgreen DB
ensures full compatibility to minimize effort in redeployment. In
particular:


* No need to reload data.
* No changes to SQL code (both DML and DDL).
* No changes to stored procedure code.
* No changes to user-defined function code.
* No changes to connectivity and
* authentication protocols such as odbc and jdbc.
* No changes to operational scripts such as
* bash backup scripts and cron jobs.

### What is the difference, then?

**More Speed** &mdash; For most OLAP workload
that is CPU-bound, Deepgreen DB runs **up to
3X faster** than Greenplum DB on average.

**More Connected** &mdash; Using [Xdrive](/products/deepgreen-db/xdrive/), Deepgreen DB
  can read/write to/from many external data external sources in a
  distributed and efficient manner.

**More Intelligent** &mdash; Using the Transducer,
  Python and Go code fragments can be directly embedded into SQL to
  group and push data to TensorFlow for machine learning.
