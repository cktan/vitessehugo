        <p>The ubiquitous cameras have produced a deluge of video files. Combining
        distributed data processing capability of a fast Data Warehouse and the online ML inferencing capability of 
	the Xilinx Alveo FPGA card, Deepgreen DB for Video Discoveries is a platform that
	enables live tagging of video files.</p>

	<p><img src="/img/video-tagging.png" style="width:90%;height=auto"></p>

        <p>The platform provides a powerful and convenient standard SQL environment conducive to
	practical data warehouse operations and, in addition, incorporates primitives that unleash 
	the power of Xilinx Alveo and ML Suite on video files.</p>

	<p>Depending on the amount of data/video and query speed required, the Deepgreen DB platform can be
	scaled out horizontally or vertically by adding compute nodes or Xilinx Alveo resources.</p>

	<p><img src="/img/deepgreen-alveo.png" style="width:90%;height=auto"></p>

	<p>Video files are distributed evenly among the Segment Nodes in the picture above. When the 
	user submits a SQL query, Deepgreen DB splits the query into jobs that it dishes out to the 
	Segment Nodes. Each Segment Node then executes the jobs and processes the video
	files residing locally in parallel, utilizing the Alveo resources attached to it. This way,
	a query multiplies its capability in scanning mp4 files by the number of Segment Nodes and 
	Alveo cards available in the cluster.</p>
